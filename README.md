# Redux-Todo
A Redux Todo application where the state is managed using Redux store and the changes are handled with the actions in the reducers.   
The database is made on a cloud MongoDB client MLab.  

The tasks are fetched from MLab by the actions in Redux store which are then shown in the React Components.
